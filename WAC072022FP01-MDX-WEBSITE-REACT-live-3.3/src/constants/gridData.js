However, the student experience at Middlesex University Dubai includes a robust sports culture that adds a distinctive and exciting aspect. While working towards your academic objectives, being part of a sports team allows you to keep your body active, meet new people, and perhaps even compete on behalf of the University team.</p><p>At Middlesex University Dubai, the commitment to sports knows no bounds. MDX take pride in providing a wide range of sports clubs and teams, both women's and men's, to cater to all interests and skill levels. These 11 sports include football, volleyball, basketball, netball, cricket, table tennis, rugby, athletics, yoga, martial arts, and badminton.</p><p>Several questions inevitably surface when pondering the prospect of joining a university sports team. One crucial query revolves around balancing academic commitments, class attendance, and the demands of rigorous sports participation.</p><p>Layana, a dedicated volleyball team member, spoke to us about how she manages to create this balance: “The sports activities happen after university hours, so I prioritise studying before that. It's easy to balance both as long as you've got proper time management skills. Planning my day, setting study goals, and staying organised is key to juggling academics and sports effectively. It's a great opportunity to improve teamwork skills and make new friends, especially if you're passionate about or interested in a sport. Being part of a team is about growth, both personally and athletically. It's a rewarding journey.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Maria, a dedicated football team member, shares her perspective on why you should consider joining a sports team at MDX. Maria says it's a rewarding journey, offering opportunities to enhance teamwork skills and make new friends. Whether passionate about a specific sport or simply interested in exploring, the experience provides personal and athletic growth: “I've been passionate about sports since a young age, so seeing how many sports teams we had here encouraged me to join football. It's excellent. Everyone is welcoming, and team bonding is valued. We all encourage and support each other.”</p><p>Maria's insights highlight the essential and enriching experience of being part of a sports team at Middlesex University Dubai. She believes that joining a sports team is a gateway to improving vital skills such as teamwork, which is highly prized in academic and professional settings. Being part of a sports team is not just about the game; it's about forging lasting friendships. Whether deeply passionate about a specific sport or simply curious to explore, joining a sports team at MDX is an exciting avenue for personal growth, challenging yourself, pushing boundaries, or discovering untapped potential.</p><p>Next, we spoke with Joshua, the second-highest scoring cricket batsman in MDX history. Joshua's journey to sporting success was shaped by the MDX coaching duo Rehan and Rizwan. The coaches stood by the team, motivating and guiding them to consistently push boundaries and give their all, regardless of circumstantial factors. Joshua's personal growth and the team's performance can be attributed to the trust and support of these dedicated coaches.</p><p>As captain of the cricket team, Joshua leads humbly, uniting everyone on the field. Every player is vital, and maintaining a collective spirit during challenging moments elevates the team:&nbsp;<br>“Personally, being captain isn't a big deal; yes, people look up to you in heated or stressful moments for inspiration, but it's nothing that big, just showing everyone that we are playing together. No one is bigger than the other person. Keeping everyone on the same level in the game and supporting everyone helps take a team out of a bad situation, and those pivotal moments help any group become a great team.”</p><p>Off the field, he encourages team members to unwind, indulge in hobbies, and build bonds unrelated to cricket. Life as a student-athlete should include moments of enjoyment and connection independent of sporting commitments or academic commitments.</p><p>In the world of athletics at Middlesex University Dubai, there's a place for everyone, regardless of your skill level. The Athletics Team is not just a group of athletes; it's a welcoming community where fitness enthusiasts can come to improve their skills. Coach Farhan and his team are dedicated to nurturing talent, whether you're an experienced athlete or just taking your first steps on the track. Coach Farhan said:</p><p>“The athletics team is a team that supports all skill levels; if you want to improve your fitness, you are always welcome to join the athletics team. You will be put through basics whether you're experienced or not, and loads of athletes still learn for 5-6 weeks.”</p><p>The Athletics Team has an exciting calendar in November, with three significant competitions in the spotlight. These include the Amity Athletics League, a challenging 3km race, and the Dubai Women's Run 3km. They're also participating in charity runs for the Dubai Fitness Challenge. The team's goal, as expressed by Coach Farhan, is to aim for victory in these events. They're determined to showcase their prowess, bring their A-game, and take home the championship titles.</p><p>Coach Farhan shared a memorable coaching experience that reflects the Athletics Team's unwavering spirit. In the final competition of the previous season, despite being up against teams with more athletes, they faced numerous challenges head-on. Their competitors underestimated them, thinking victory was assured. But the MDX Athletics Team surprised everyone with their sheer competitiveness and clinched the win. This story illustrates the incredible persistence, determination, and confidence that Coach Farhan admires in his team, and it's a source of immense pride for all involved.</p><p>Middlesex University Dubai offers students a well-rounded personal growth and development journey. Whether you are a dedicated athlete looking to hone your skills or simply curious to explore the world of sports, MDX provides a nurturing environment where you can push your boundaries, make lifelong friends, and learn invaluable teamwork and time management lessons. The stories of Layana, Maria, and Joshua, along with the dedication of Coach Farhan and the other coaches, exemplify the unwavering spirit and determination that define the MDX community. It's where champions are born and forged through hard work, passion, and the unshakable support of a university that values academic and athletic pursuits. Join the MDX sports community and embark on a journey of personal and athletic growth that will last a lifetime.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>If you are interested in joining the Middlesex University Dubai sports community, don't hesitate to visit The MDX Gym on the 3rd Floor of Block 15 or the Student Activities Office in the Social Hub.

          //               '<p>On Saturday 14th January, over 100 past students of Middlesex University Dubai came together to celebrate their successes at our Alumni Association Event.&nbsp;</p><p>The Dubai Knowledge Village Campus opened its doors in the early evening and the alumni of all programmes immediately began filing in, with familiar face after familiar face being welcomed by the MDX faculty.&nbsp;</p><p>During some initial mingling time, there was the lovely opportunity to speak with ex-students about their experience and where their journey has taken them since university. Some, such as Deepak Mirchandani and Vrunda Sharma who both graduated with a BA Hons in Accounting and Finance, have gone on to forge careers in the industry they set out for.&nbsp;</p><p>After working as a Senior Consultant, Deepak is now Assistant Manager at Grant Thornton, one of the world\'s largest professional services networks of independent accounting and consulting member firms. He talked about how it felt to be back on campus for the first time since 2016:</p><p>"It\'s definitely nostalgic, coming back. It\'s been five or six years now and the university has grown… Aside from the technical elements of our degree, one of the things we learned here was how to be around people, how to interact and work with different groups of people with different backgrounds, goals, and aspirations. I think that\'s very important for anyone\'s future."</p><p>Some students, however, had taken their degree skills and applied them to achieve completely different career paths. Maryam Ather Ali, who graduated in 2013, studied BSc Psychology with Counselling Skills and is now a freelance photographer. When asked what she took from her degree into her entrepreneurial life, she said:</p><p>"What I learned as a Counselling student was to never judge anyone, and I have developed the skill of being a great listener. That\'s something I\'ve carried forward since graduating that has really helped me in my career; just being a good listener, being there for people."</p><p>Once the foyer began to fill with excited Alumni, the crowd moved to the Barnet Auditorium where they were greeted with a warm and welcoming introduction by Pro-Vice Chancellor and Director of Middlesex University Dubai, Dr Cedwyn Fernandes. Dr Cedwyn has had personal involvement in the education of many of these students, and following the event, he said of the evening:&nbsp;</p><p>"It was great to meet with our Alumni and share their success stories; nothing gives educators more joy than seeing their students happy in their careers and life. Our Alumni shared with us how Middlesex University Dubai prepared them for their careers, and many mentioned the rigorous syllabus and top-class teaching. They were able to acquire professional certifications while studying at the University, and they had the opportunity to develop their interpersonal skills by volunteering and taking on internships in a multicultural environment. The University provided them with amazing opportunities to interact with industry and organisations in their field, and their time at Middlesex University Dubai equipped them with critical thinking and lifelong learning skills to deal with rapidly changing technology and job roles successfully. We all are so very proud of our Alumni."</p><p>Following their welcome from Dr Cedwyn, the Alumni were invited by the Chair of the Office of Alumni Relations Dr Fehmida Hussain to participate in an engaging short panel discussion, where four ex-students talked through their degrees and career progressions. The panel consisted of Saher Khan (LLB Hons Law, class of 2018); Chuka Ekweogwu (MSc Engineering Management, class of 2014); Priyanka Awatramani (BA Hons Accounting and Finance, class of 2020); and Dana Akkad (BA Hons Public Relations, Creative Advertising and Branding, class of 2021), all of whom now have professional roles in law, acting and film, finance, and TV production respectively.</p><p>After the engaging panel discussion, the MDX faculty took some time to award the \'Recognition of Self Determination\' award to Jainesh Thadhani from the class of 2022, acknowledging his exceptional determination in graduating from MDX\'s BSC Honours Business Information Systems Program with a first-class degree.&nbsp;</p><p>Nicely warmed up, the crowds then gathered back in the atrium area to watch some performances from current MDX students, and play a spot of Alumni Bingo, in which they were tasked to network around the room and write down the names of people they met who fit criteria on their bingo cards; a fun way to get to know some new faces in the crowd!&nbsp;</p><p>As the evening came to a close, Dr Fehmida Hussain distributed a few more awards and prizes, and told us:&nbsp;</p><p>"The Office of Alumni Relations was delighted to welcome so many alumni back onto campus. Alumni and faculty got an excellent opportunity to reconnect and reminisce about life at MDX, reunite with old friends and expand professional networks. We hope [attendees] enjoyed the mix of games, talks and the alumni panel!&nbsp;</p><p>This event will herald a series of alumni events and reunions we hope to organise over the next couple of months."</p><p>Middlesex University Dubai plans to develop a whole calendar of special alumni events in the coming future, in order for our students past and present to connect and form bonds that mutually benefit their careers and opportunities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To make sure you can attend, <a href="https://www.mdx.ac.ae/alumni/stay-connected">update your contact details here</a>.</p><p>For more photos from the occasion, <a href="https://www.mdx.ac.ae/alumni/gallery">view our online gallery here.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Until the next one!</p>',

With people staying at home and remote work becoming a viable option, the role of this technology in letting us stay connected with each other has become even more critical. When compared with more traditional forms of online communication, VR/AR devices allow users to have a much more immersive experience. Several applications and experiences have been developed, for professional interaction as well as for entertainment purposes. It's increasingly clear that VR/AR appears to provide a viable platform for promoting social connectedness. Given the availability and convenience of accessing this technology, there is great potential in developing such networked experiences, with multiple people interacting with each other in the same virtual space.</p><p>While these applications allow people to connect in a virtual space, several aspects of this interaction need to be understood better. In this context, this special track welcomes submissions on the use of immersive technologies, such as VR and AR, specifically related to their role in advancing social connectedness. This multidisciplinary track focuses on various factors, including, but not limited to:</p><p><strong>Potential Applications</strong></p><p>·&nbsp;Multi-user applications in VR/AR for specific use-cases, such as education (virtual classrooms), professional interactions, recreation, etc.</p><p>· Cross-platform applications, which allow multiple users to connect via VR/AR devices, mobile devices, and desktops/laptops.</p><p>·&nbsp;Potential applications of single-user VR/AR experiences that facilitate social connectedness.</p><p><strong>Technical Challenges - Hardware, Software, Networking</strong></p><p>·&nbsp; Approaches for tracking user movements in VR.</p><p>· Methods for ensuring a smooth visual experience - Focusing on graphics quality, variability in hardware, network latency issues, etc.</p><p>·&nbsp; Design and evaluation of consistent user interfaces and user interactions in VR/AR.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Design and evaluation of virtual characters that represent the users in VR (e.g., animation, perceptual evaluation)</p><p>·&nbsp;Methods for synchronising various sensory streams (audio, visual, haptic, etc.).</p><p><strong>Human Factors and Psychological Impact</strong></p><p>· Theoretical perspectives of understanding the use of VR/AR for social connectedness.</p><p>·&nbsp; Potential impact (socio-economic, cultural, environmental) of using VR/AR in the workplace.</p><p>·&nbsp; Challenges in applying VR/AR in the workplace (employee motivation, cost-effectiveness, productivity, and efficiency)</p><p>·&nbsp; Methods for measuring and understanding the impact of human factors for interaction in VR/AR.</p><p>·&nbsp; Approaches for tackling issues related to biases, diversity, and inclusion with user representation in VR/AR.</p>",
